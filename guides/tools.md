# Tools
## Looker Data Store
The Looker Data Store is a collection of LookML files, Looker documentation, and best practices for building, validating, and troubleshooting LookML models and Looker dashboards. It is used to provide syntax validation, error correction, and guidance on configuring Looker models. The data store contains flattened repositories of LookML files and Looker-related documentation in plain text, making it efficient for querying and validation tasks.
## BigQuery Data Store
The BigQuery Data Store contains resources for optimizing and troubleshooting SQL queries generated by LookML, including error messages, best practices, and query optimization techniques. It serves as a reference for diagnosing SQL issues, improving query performance, and ensuring efficient resource utilization in BigQuery. The datastore is structured to facilitate quick retrieval of error logs, performance recommendations, and best practices.
## OpenAPI
The OpenAPI tool allows for interaction with external APIs, enabling users to query and retrieve data from various external services. It is designed to handle API requests, process external data queries, and serve as a fallback for general-purpose tasks that donâ€™t fall under the scope of Looker or BigQuery-specific operations. The OpenAPI integration ensures smooth external data interactions and is capable of making requests to other services as needed. This OpenAPI specification is used to interact with the Gemini 1.5 Flash within the Looker and BigQuery ecosystem. It enables querying external services, processing data, and handling general-purpose tasks outside the scope of Looker or BigQuery-specific operations. The Gemini API integration allows for advanced AI-driven interactions, such as natural language processing, code generation, and data insights.
